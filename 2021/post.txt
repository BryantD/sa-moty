It's the end of the year, and... yeah.

[b]Top 20 MotYC Participants (24 with ties)[/b]

The Elite is clearly the best faction in the world. 

FTR had a great December with 2 MOTYCs, more than anyone else except Chuck Taylor. That gets Cash Wheeler on the list; Dax was already in our top 20 thanks to a singles match. Sammy Guevara and Brian Danielson also debuted. Nobody dropped off.

TJPW Wrestle Princess and NJPW G1 Night 15 combined for a third day with 7 MOTYCs. Despite it all there was a lot of good wrestling last year.

It's December 4th, and you know what that means!

[b]Top 20 MotYC Participants (21 with ties)[/b]

The race is for second place now, with four wrestlers grouped tightly enough so that it's anyone's game, particularly with the Bucks injured. Shingo would really need to show up in some tag matches during Road to Tokyo Dome, though, so we'll see.

Debuting on the list this month: Eddie and Dax Harwood (with a bullet, since he had 3 MOTYCs). Dropping off: Mox, Baliyan Akki, Emi Sakura, and Ryo Mizunami.

We also have a new best night co-champion: Full Gear saw 7 MOTYCs to join Double or Nothing.

It's November 3rd, and you know what that means!

Shingo isn't catching up with Omega -- the Best Bout Machine is, uh, Best Bouting.

Danielson is lurking at 5 nominations. What a run he's having. Gotta figure he'll be in the top five next year.

Still anyone's race to win, although Penta has opened up a little daylight with Darby out.

It's October 1st, and you know what that means...

Tweaked the format a bit this month to include everyone tied for the last spot, so it'll be somewhere between 20-30 wrestlers on each list.

[b]Top 20 MotYC Participants[/b]

Shingo is the only person who stands a chance of catching up to Omega, and that's probably dependent on his participation in the WTL.

And all credit to Jerusalem for doing the hard work of collating; there's no way I could automate all the work he does.
