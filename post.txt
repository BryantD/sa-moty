===== 2022 Roundup ====

And that's a wrap! 

[b]Top 20 MotYC Participants[/b]

Moxley's lead was big enough to hold up during the last quarter of the year. Fenix was a surprise, adding a big 6 matches to his list -- turns out wrestling a lot of great trios matches will do that for you. (Yes, he really did have six more MOTYCs than Penta -- AAA, a match at that Ric Flair show, some Rampage, etc.)

===== September 2022

[b]Top 20 MotYC Participants[/b]

Quiet month, relatively speaking. The American Dragon, Chris Jericho, Adam Page, and Moxley were the only wrestlers with multiple MotYC nominations. That puts Mox alone at the top of the list for the first time this year. Spoiler: he's still on top of the HM list too. Just wild.

175 wrestlers have MotYC nods so far this year, up 3 from last month.

[b]Top 26 HM Participants[/b]

Orange Cassidy wins the HM race for September with 3 noms. Chuck and Trent? are right behind him with 2 each. Darby Allin made up some ground on Moxley! Also I caught an error that cost Rey Fenix 1 nomination, so that's fixed now.

===== August 2022

Did you ever upgrade your python version and watch all your code fall apart into a big steaming pile of crap in the middle of your hard drive and you can't even remember how you turned off the loop on the animated GIFs in the first place? Just me? Cool.

[b]Top 21 MotYC Participants[/b]

Moxley and Okada are still neck and neck. Will Ospreay is the big mover here with five MotYC nods this month, with a bunch of the other usual suspects picking up 2 each. The trios tournament and the G1 continued to drive overall nominations. Hope Sammy isn't getting too comfortable in that top ten.

[b]Top 23 HM Participants[/b]

Jamie Hayter, Rika Tatsumi, and Yuka Sakazaki all had 3 HM nods in August. In some ways this is a more interesting list because it captures all the MotYCs that not enough of us saw, maybe? 

Remind me to change Penta's alias back next month, since he seems to be done with Oscuro for now.

===== July 2022

[b]Top 23 MotYC Participants[/b]

Moxley has surpassed Sammy and is coming up on Okada. The usual G1 suspects are doing their thing, and Daniel Garcia also had a couple of nominations this month which gets him onto the leaderboards.

I bet the trios tournament is going to be a big driver for a lot of these guys next month.

===== June 2022

[b]Top 19 MotYC Participants[/b]

What the hell got into Moxley? I double checked, and this is accurate -- he had four MotYCs in June. That's pretty impressive for people who aren't competing in the G1 and who aren't named Kenny Omega. 

I am not going to start tracking by stable, but my, BCC is looking sharp right now.

Big movers this month with 2 MotYCs apiece: Eddie Kingston, El Desperado, El Lindaman, El Phantasmo, Hangman Adam Page, Jungle Boy, Ricky Starks, Robbie Eagles, Swerve Strickland, Tomohiro Ishii, and Wardlow. You could build a promotion around those guys.

===== April 2022

[b]Top 20 MotYC Participants[/b]

Okada owning more MotYCs than anyone else: not surprising. Sammy Guevara keeping pace: somewhat of a shock! Special medal for Bandido for winning the non-AEW/NJPW division at least until he's formally signed to ROH.
